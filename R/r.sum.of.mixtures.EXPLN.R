function(k,n,p.vector,mu.vector,sigma.vector,lambda) {
# Draws k i.i.d. random variables from the following distribution:
# Each random variable is the sum of another n independent random variables.
# These are from a mixture of zero, one or more lognormal distributions and
# one exponential distribution. More specifically, with probability p_i (i=1,...,T-1),
# a summand is of type i. In that case, it is lognormally
# distributed with log-mean mu_i and log-standard deviation sigma_i.
# With probability p_T, it is exponentially distributed with rate lambda.
#
# Parameters:
#
# - k is the number of i.i.d. random variables returned by this function
#   (in the considered application: number of tissue samples)
# - n is the number of summands entering each of the k random variables. This can also be a vector stating how many
#   summands enter each random variable seperatly. (in the considered application: number of cells per tissue sample)
# - p.vector=(p1,p2,..,pT) is the probability for each type
# - mu.vector=(mu1,mu2,...,mu{T-1]) is the log-mean for each lognormal type
# - sigma.vector=(sigma1,...,sigma{T-1}) is the log-standard deviation for each lognormal type
# - lambda is the rate for the exponential type
#
# The lengths mu.vector and sigma.vector have to be identical.
# p.vector has to have one component more.
# lambda has to be a scalar.
# These lengths automatically determine the number of different types.

   # check for some obvious errors
