# Parameters:
#
# - the density is evaluated at y
# - n is the number of random variables entering the sum
# - p.vector is a vector containing the probabilities for each type of cell.

# - mu.vector is the vector with mu-values for each type.
# - sigma.vector is the vector with sigma-values for each type.   
# - if logdens==T, the log of this density is returned
