# Density for a sum of independent lognormally distributed variables, 
# using the approximation method by Fenton [1].
#
# - density is evaluated at y, which can be multi-dimensional
#
# - j.vector=(j1,...,jT) is a vector indicating how many of the summands are of
#   which type: 
#         j1 are of type I, ..., jT are of type T.
#   The sum n=j1+...+jT implies how many summands are entering the sum.
#
# - mu.vector=(mu1,...,muT) is of the same length as j.vector. mu_i is the 
#   log-mean for type i.
#
# - sigma.vector is defined analogously as mu.vector. It contains the standard
#   deviations (not variances!) of the according normal distributions.   
# 
# - if logdens==T, the log of this density is returned.
