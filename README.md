# stochprofML - Disclaimer
This is the new version of the original stochprofML package (see: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stochprofML Version 1.2).
The main difference is that you can use different n's, i.e. a dataset where each tissue sample originates from a different number of cells.
We used this on pheno-seq (see: Tirier, S.M., Park, J., Preußer, F. et al. Pheno-seq – linking visual features and gene expression in 3D cell culture systems. Sci Rep 9, 12367 (2019) <doi:10.1038/s41598-019-48771-4>).
