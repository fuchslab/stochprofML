# stochprofML - Disclaimer
This is an extension of the original stochprofML package (see: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stochprofML).
The main difference is that you can use different n's, i.e. a dataset where each tissue sample originates from a different number of cells.
We used this on pheno-seq (see: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/01/311472). 
Will test it in detail and revise it and upload it soon as a new package version 2.0.
